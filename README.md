\# Image Classification (my own small dataset)



This is a very simple image classification project.

I created a small dataset myself and trained a basic model on it.



\## What the project does

\- loads my small image dataset

\- trains a simple model

\- tests it with a few images



\## Files

\- images/ → my small dataset (I collected the pictures)

\- model.ipynb → training notebook
